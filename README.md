# 🏥 AI-Based Patient Readmission Prediction System

This project builds and serves an **AI system** that predicts whether a patient is at risk of being **readmitted to the hospital within 30 days** after discharge.  
It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and a REST API built with **Flask**.
